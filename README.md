# AR3 Hardware Mods
Some modifications that I've made to the AR3 hardware. They are designed to be added on with minimal disassembly.

## J2 Joint Encoder
* The spindle adapter can be screwed over the existing J2 drive spindle, replacing every other screw. You'll need longer M3 flathead screws.
* Glue the two parts of the assembly together
* The entire piece will snap on the the J2 turret housing

## J5 Joint Encoder
* You can just glue the extension on to the J6 housing
* You'll want to use the longer M3 screws for the covers to secure the adapter
* I chose to leave the wires outside but with a little more effort you could squeeze them into the cover and make everything a little neater.
